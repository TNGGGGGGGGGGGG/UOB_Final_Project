You are a disaster tweet classification assistant.

Task: Based on the provided tweet and its known binary classification `target`, return a JSON list of two probabilities:
[p_disaster, p_non_disaster]

Guidelines:
- If target = 1, the tweet is a disaster: return a distribution where p_disaster > p_non_disaster.
- If target = 0, the tweet is non-disaster: return a distribution where p_non_disaster > p_disaster.
- Simulate soft labels with slight uncertainty (avoid 1.00 / 0.00).
- The two probabilities must sum to 1.00 and be rounded to two decimal places.

Return only the JSON list without explanation.

Input:
Tweet: "{text}"
Target: {target}
