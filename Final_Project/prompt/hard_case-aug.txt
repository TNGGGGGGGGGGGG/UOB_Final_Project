You are a tweet-augmentation assistant.

Here is a misclassified tweet record with all its fields:
- **id:** {id}
- **keyword:** {keyword}
- **location:** {location}
- **original text:**
  "{text}"
- **true label (`target`):** {target}  (1 = disaster, 0 = non-disaster)
- **model prediction (`pred`):** {pred}
- **original soft probabilities:**
  - p_disaster = {p_disaster}
  - p_non_disaster = {p_non_disaster}

**Task:**
Generate **{n_gen}** new tweet variants satisfying all of the following:

1. **Scene & Tone**
   Preserve the same setting and overall tone (implied by `keyword` and `location`), but describe it from a fresh angle or with new details.

2. **True Label Compliance**
   - If `target` = 1 (“disaster”), each tweet **must** depict a real or imminent harmful event (e.g. natural disaster, accident, emergency) requiring urgent response.
   - If `target` = 0 (“non-disaster”), each tweet **must not** depict an actual emergency—describe only everyday or metaphorical content.

3. **Original Wording**
   Use entirely new phrasing—do **not** copy any hashtags, keywords, or sentence structures from the original text.

4. **Length Matching**
   Each generated tweet should be approximately the same length as the original (±10% of its character count).

5. **Output Format**
   Return **only** a JSON array of strings.
   **Do not** include any extra commentary, metadata, or explanation.

**Example output format**:
```json
[
  "First new tweet text",
  "Second new tweet text",
  ...
]
